    <div class="marble-solitaire">
        <h2>Marble Solitaire.</h2>
        <p>For this project I used Java to develop a
            <a class="project-link"
                href="https://www.maplelandmark.com/instructions/marble-solitaire">Marble
                Solitaire</a>
            game that is fully playable in the console. I used the Model View Controller design
            so that I could easily go back and make changes or add features. For example, I first
            started
            with the classic English Solitaire board, then I added on the European and Triangle
            Solitaire
            boards as well.

    <div class="hangman">
        <h2>Hangman.</h2>
        <p>This was my first project using Python. I implemented a fun console
            <a class="project-link" href="https://www.wikihow.com/Play-Hangman">Hangman</a> game
            where there were over 200 words that the program would randomly choose from. I also
            used some console art that displayed the Hangman figure and how many limbs he had left.
            It was a fun project and I'm looking forward to making many more in Python!

    <div class="flood-it">
        <h2>Flood It.</h2>
        <p>I pair-programmed a
            <a class="project-link" href="https://unixpapa.com/floodit/">Flood It</a>
            (note: this site is not my own) game in Java that had a flooding or cascading effect. I
            used
            the Impworld Library to implement an interactive display for the user to play the game.
            It showed how many lives were left, and the board. Size of the board and how many
            colors used can be specified when initializing the game. There was also
            a default constructor that automatically set the amount of colors to four, and the board
            size to 10 by 10.

    <div class="n-bullets">
        <h2>NBullets.</h2>
        <p>
            I pair-programmed a game in Java called NBullets which was a shooter game which started
            off
            with <em>n</em> bullets. The graphics &mdash; which were created using the Funworld
            Library
            &mdash; were fairly simple as everything was just a circle,
            but "ships" would randomly spawn at the edges of the screen. The screen also displays
            the number of ships destroyed and bullets left. Another feature we added was that when
            a bullet hits a ship, the speed and size of the bullet increases as well as the bullet
            exploding into multiple other bullets. These new bullets keep track of the amount of
            times the "explosion" has happened, and more and more bullets will come from the
            "explosions".

    <div class="maze-generator">
        <h2>Maze Generator.</h2>
        <p>I also pair-programmed a Maze Generator using Java that randomly produces a solvable maze
            every
            time it is run. The program utilizes
            <a class="project-link"
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kruskal%27s_algorithm">Kruskal's Algorithm</a>
            and <a class="project-link"
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disjoint-set_data_structure">Union Find</a>
            to create these solvable mazes. We programmed it so that the generator automatically
            creates a
            20 by 20 cell maze, but it is easily changeable. The maze display was created using the
            Impworld Library,
            and it features a start and end cell denoted by their different coloring.

    <div class="this-website">
        <h2>This Website.</h2>
        <p>I created this website using HTML, CSS, and my own artwork! I drew everything excluding
            the two
            gifs on the home page (which I've linked below), but I plan on changing those soon to
            something of my own design. This
            is my first website, and I had so much fun making it! I plan on developing and designing
            many more
            in the future, so feel free to reach out to discuss any freelance work I can do for you!
